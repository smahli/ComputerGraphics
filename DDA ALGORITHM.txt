
 This program is all about Digital Differential Analyzer(DDA)
 Algorithm for DDA Line drawing is given below
  1.Get the input the two end points  (X0,Y0) and (X1,Y2) 
  2.Calculate the difference between two points of a straight line
  3. dx=X1-X0;
  4. dy=Y1-Y0;
  5. Identify the number of steps to put pixels
  6.if(dx>dy)
  7.   steps=absolute(dx);
  8.else
  9.   steps=absolute(dy);
 10.Calculate the increment in x and y coordinate
 11.Xc=dx/steps
 12.Yc=dy/steps
 13.Put the pixel by incrementing x and y coordinates accordigly 
 14.x=x+Xc;
 15.y=y+Yc;
 16.x=x1;
 17.y=y1;
